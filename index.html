				<p>My name is Jacqueline Marx, but most people call me Jackie. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA.  
				I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, studying Computer Engineering.  
				My expected graduation date in December of 2018.</p>
				<p>I took my first programming class during my freshman year of high school (Visual Basic), and found it was something I wanted to persue.
				Since then I have participated in a variety of project, including custom Salesforce development, some .NET projects, and a lot SQL query writing. 
				You can see more details about various projects I've worked on through my <a href="projects.html">Projects Page</a>.</p>
				<p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with family, playing tennis (although I'm not very good), and traveling.
				Hopefully, through this webpage, you can see a bit on my work and get to know be better.  If you have questions or suggestions feel free to 
				<a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.</p>
